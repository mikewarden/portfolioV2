   <h6>Busy Week.</h6>
   <p>So in preparation for the upcoming bootcamp, I decided to brush up on various aspects of coding. Rather than going through or back through online courses on javascript etc.. I took the build-something-cool route. 
   I started off by looking through what free APIs are out there and ran into the free NASA API, which has acess to tons of interesting information on Near-Earth-Objects, Geomagnetic Storm data, and lots of other cool stuff. I decided to build a small project that uses a get JSON request to parse through and display recent Coronal Mass Ejection activity data. Click on the pic below to check it out on my CodePen.
   <br>
   <a href="https://codepen.io/mikewarden/full/WqaEgX" target="_blank"><img src="nasaapidata.jpg" alt="Displays recent CME data from Nasa API."/></a>
   <br>
   
   After that I decided to look into an interesting Javascript framework called <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/" target="_blank">Tone.JS</a>. It essentially allows one to create music in the browser utilizing various virtual components such as oscillators, sequencers, transport functionality and gain stages to build virtual devices which can be used in conjunction with MIDI and other software platforms like Max/MSP. 
        
        Definitely lots of fun. I made a simple keyboard synth with some weird chaining of delay effects. Again, click on the screenshot below if you want to check it out.

   <h6>Summer has arrived.</h6>
   <p>So I've decided to up my skills via a highly reputable software coding bootcamp and it seems extremely worthwhile to do so- more details at some point. Also working on some new songs and an early version (subject to constant updating) of a random password generator. Below is a screenshot of an early version, click on it to check it out on codepen.

   <h6>Just moved.</h6>
   <p>It has been radio silence for the past couple months. I just moved a little further Southeast and got a new job. Unfortunately the new job is not a developer position, but I have to pay the bills in the mean time. Now that I have gotten settled in, I expect to finish some of these unfinished projects as mentioned in previous posts. Also just made some changes to the random background function and updated my profile pic(which should reflect my hair length more accurately).  </p>

   <h6>Pi Times.</h6>
   <p>I finally got my Raspberry Pi Zero W delivered. The Debian-based Operating System- Raspian seems to work pretty well over all. Chromium browser runs slow, but at least it runs. I have been working mostly on simple projects like the Trek-themed Choose-your-own-adventure command-line game(almost done with the Captains adventure). Some of the audio applications are having trouble loading or working at all. I have yet to get Sonic Pi to start up without totally crashing, even after updates and reinstallation. I have heard similair accounts from people with the same issues. Perhaps I will use the Zero models for basic programming and simple camera projects and wait until I acquire a couple of Pi 3s to begin experimenting with audio or the expansion boards. Nevertheless, it is pretty cool having a 1Ghz PC the size of a first generation ipod shuffle. Other than that, I have been spending a lot of time working with Node JS in regards to server building and file manipulation. Below is a pic with my Pi Zero running Geany IDE with a behind-the-scenes preview of that command-line game.  </p>

   <h6>Ok, I'm still here.</h6>
   <p>Happy New Year! Not a lot to report here. Just waiting on my Raspberry Pi Zero to be delivered. I ordered some extra components to maximize its potential for future projects. I have also been working on a Trek-themed command-line-based choose-your-own-adventure game using Python for fun ( and especially since I need to brush up on Python for the Raspberry Pi projects). </p>

   <h6>Update- long overdue.</h6>
   <p>So again, been busy, but since I don't use social media much, I suppose I should make use of my blog a bit more. There isnt much to say about changes to the site, although I have had some bots and trolls littering my comment database, so Ive had to take some more security measures and block specific IP addresses from this site, but one can only expect as much, haha. <br><br>Aside from all that, I have been spending more time using React. Specifically, Im currently working on the final project for the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-in-2018/" target="_blank">Udemy Web Development course</a> Im taking which makes use of the Facial Recognition API built by <a href="https://clarifai.com/" target="_blank">Clarifai</a> as well as the <a href="https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/" target="_blank">Particles.JS</a> library. I should have some updates once the back end of the project is completed and launched.  In case you like weird electronic music, I also recently finished the latest album release for my solo music project <em>Coyote Amulet</em> available on <a href="https://mikewarden.bandcamp.com/album/theatre-of-neurotic-delusion" target="_blank">BandCamp</a>.</p>

   <h6>Site Overhaul</h6>
   <p>I have been taking a break from the blog posting due mostly to working on smaller projects and ideas. For example, I recently completed my version of a vanilla JavaScript shopping list pen for a Udemy Developer course I'm taking, check it <a href="https://codepen.io/mikewarden/pen/bKBENp" target="_blank">here</a>. Also, I finally executed a major overhaul to the site. The main page, bio and blog section have been completely redesigned with a randomly selected background upon each page load(just a few lines of Javascript). If the old design is more appealing, it can be found on the navigation bar titled "Bizzaro Version". I'm starting to get more acquainted with React and ES6 and moving further away from jQuery, though I'm not quite to the point of refactoring older projects....yet. lol. </p>

   <h6>Fun with React</h6>
   <p>It has been about a month since my last update, but for good reason I suppose. Ive been heavily engaged in learning React JS. It certainly is an interesting way of approaching web development. As an electronic musician, I would compare React to a modular synthesizer, in that a modular synthesizer uses different components that perform a specific function to alter the incoming signal. It's challenging but enjoyable. Other than that I recently added an erase-when-double-clicked feature to the <a href="http://mikewarden.com/pixelArtMaker/main.html" target="_blank">pixel art maker</a> and made an <a href="https://codepen.io/mikewarden/full/mxMgbL/" target="_blank">alien database</a> with category buttons and a search feature on codepen. I hope to improve on the concept by using React to build something similair in the future. Well, back to work in React and get on an NPM start command.</p>

   <h6>It's a Thursday</h6>
   <p>So I just finished <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp's</a> Wikipedia Viewer challenge. Initially it was a bit of a struggle to to get the data from the Wikipedia API. At first I tried jQuery $ajax requests and xmlhttp requests where I had success in the past but kept running into bugs. I ended up using the get.JSON method in jQuery and had an easier time extracting the object information I needed. The end result is available in the project section on the main page or just go <a href="http://mikewarden.com/wikiViewer/main.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

   <h6>Wacky Wedensday</h6>
   <p>Greetings friends. It's been a long week and a half. I just wrapped up the Grow with Google Scholarship Challenge Phase 1. I won't konw anything further until mid April about the results. However I did adapt the final project into my own version of a <a href="http://mikewarden.com/pixelArtMaker/main.html" target="_blank">pixel art maker</a>. Also planning on incorporating some glyphicons into the site in general, but I'm still deciding which ones to use. I'm considering the idea of a quiz page but not sure, it's still a raw idea. If you like <a href="http://mikewarden.com/copperSatellites/home.html" target="_blank">Copper Satellites</a>, we just put up a new track on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-814555981/cubesphere" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>. Before I forget, binge watching Altered Carbon in one day can turn your next few days into a bleak dystopia, lol, jk.</p>

   <h6> Time Slip </h6>
   <p>Uggh. I feel like I lost a week somehow. Perhaps it was the red-blue moon, lol. Though I have also been spending considerable time working on new ideas, as well as working through the Google Developer Scholarship, the latter taking up most of my time. However I would be a lying if I said that it's all work and no play. ;) I was just catching up on one of my favorite podcasts,<a href="https://www.gralienreport.com/" target="_blank">the Gralien Report</a> and the Netflix miniseries, <em>'Wormwood'</em>. If you like weird stuff, I would recommend either. That being said I plan on including links to some of my favorite podcasts, authors, books and other media in future blog posts. <br> Updates include: <br>-minor css and background changes for the main page.<br>-Context variable updates on <a href="http://mikewarden.com/randomArtGen/main.html" target="_blank">Random Art Generator</a>. <br>Also went on a rather treacherous hike upon steep terrain on North Mountain in Phoenix Arizona. A week and a half later my body is still sore.  Below is a picture from mid hike.</p>

   <h6> Cloudy Day </h6>
   <p>It's cloudy outside, fairly overcast, but it won't rain. Oh well. On the other hand, I just found out that I was chosen for the <em>Grow with Google Developer Challenge Scholarship</em>! Having completed a number of tutorials and programs already like Codecademy, StackSkills, and 260 plus challenges in freeCodeCamp, it does feel a bit redundant to be going over the basics again. However, every developer has unique stylistic qualities and methods for workflow and it helps to see things from many different angles, even if they are fairly rudementary concepts. Also any good developer never stops learning new things, especially in changing digital terrain. <br> Some changes and additions will be made to <a href="http://mikewarden.com/divClipsV1/main.html" target="_blank">DivClips</a> such as different sequencer templates and design.<br> Also stay tuned for some updates on Copper Satellites... </p>

   <p>Greetings! More updates have been made to the <a href="http://mikewarden.com/randomArtGen/main.html" target="_blank">Random Art Generator</a>. I changed some of the random values to encompass a wider scope within the canvas, as well as randomization on the stroke width. More soon on that. <br> I have also finally implemented a bio section to the site accessble above on the navigation bar. If you were wondering who is this guy?, I have begun to lift the veil, lol. </p>

   <p>The canvas project involving random output has been realized! <a href="http://mikewarden.com/randomArtGen/main.html" target="_blank">Random Art Generator</a> is now up and running. Essentially, it generates randomly placed canvas strokes and figures. It is still under development, as I am adding more versatility by adding more variables to the program. But if you are into digitally generated minimalism, enjoy! </p>
